intro: |
    <p><strong>Manuel Bieh</strong>, born in the late summer of 1984 in Dortmund, Germany now living and working in <strong>Berlin</strong>.</p>

    <p>My life probably got noteworthy in the year 2000, when I began to work for an agency for internet solutions as an intern, one year later as an apprentice. Three years later, in June 2005, I got my first degree as <strong>Digital Media Designer</strong> (specialized in Online Media). This was just the beginning and so I decided to begin a two-year advanced training at the Chamber of Industry and Commerce as a <strong>Media Engineer</strong> which I successfully completed in August 2008.</p>

    <p>While I was completing my training I worked as <strong>Freelance Web Developer</strong> for several agencies as well as for own clients, as Author and Expert for various magazines and as employed <strong>Web Developer</strong> for the raphael GmbH. In May 2008 I founded my first company Mobilistics GmbH, one of the first companies in Germany spezialized in developing and optimizing websites for mobile devices. During that time I also published the first German book about <strong>Mobile Webdesign</strong> at the prestigious German publisher Galileo Computing (now: Rheinwerk).</p>

    <p>After a first short trip into the world of entrepreneurship as <strong>Technical Lead</strong> and <strong>CEO</strong> of the Mobilistics GmbH and other very interesting experiences as <strong>Software Developer</strong> at Sevenval, one of the biggest technology providers for mobile solutions in Europe, as <strong>IT Consultant</strong> for itemis AG and as <strong>Co-Founder and CTO</strong> of ubiiqu GmbH I am now working as <strong>Freelance Developer</strong> again. A profession I have always enjoyed and still do.</p>

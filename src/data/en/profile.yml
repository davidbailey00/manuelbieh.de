    <p>Manuel Bieh, born in the late summer of 1984 in Dortmund, Germany.</p>
    <p>My life probably got noteworthy in the year 2000, when I began to work for an agency for internet solutions as an intern, one year later as an apprentice. Three years later, in June 2005, I got my first degree as digital media designer.</p>
    <p>This ought not be enough and so I decided to complete a two-year advanced training at the chamber of industry and commerce as a media engineer which I successfully completed  in August 2008.</p>
    <p>After a short trip into the world of entrepreneurship as technical lead and CEO of the Mobilistics GmbH, where I was developing professional web applications for mobile devices, I am now again working as an employed software developer at the Sevenval GmbH in Cologne. Besides I'm avocationally completing a study of Business Administration at the University of Applied Sciences for Economy and Management (FOM) in Dortmund.</p>
    <p>Beyond that, I published my first technical book entitled "Mobiles Webdesign" at the prestigious german publisher "Galileo Computing" in June 2008.</p>

title: Clients
intro: |
    <p>Sometimes sweat and tears but always a lot of fun and new experiences. There's one thing all these clients have in common:
        I'm proud and grateful for every single one who trusted me with their project!</p>

    <p>To date I've worked for various clients from very different areas and industries. Directly for the clients or
    as external extension of an agency's team. For big companies, small companies, medium sized companie. For startups, for
    corporations, for startups which behaved like corporations and for corporations which still were of the opinion to still
    be a startup (looking at you, Zalando! ;))</p>

    <p>Here is an excerpt of some of the companies and brands I've worked for in the past:</p>

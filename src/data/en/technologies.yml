title: Technologies
intro: |
    <p>In the past 15 years I was working as Developer there was barely any web technology I had not at least marginally
    used at some point. I laid the foundation of my professional career doing HTML (optimized for IE5 and Netscape 4.7
    at that time), a bit later I also started using CSS (which indeed was not available at the time I began using HTML).</p>

    <p>In 1998, at the tender age of 14, I used my pocket money to buy my first book about <strong>JavaScript</strong> and, well,
    I'm still using it today! (The language of course, not the book! ;))</p>

    <p>Between 2004 and 2008 I had the desire to make some new experiences and broaden my knowledge and so I switchted to mostly
    doing PHP- and MySQL backend development during that time. With the rise of HTML 5 early 2009 I then switched back
    to doing frontend development with HTML, CSS and JavaScript almost exclusively.</p>

    <p>As time flew by the share of JavaScript in my daily work grew continuously, in 2011 I also started doing some smaller
    Node.js projects, later I did some more and bigger Node.js projects and in the meantime I have also published some
    <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/~manuelbieh">own Node modules on npm</a> and so I'd now consider myself more of a
    JavaScript Developer than a Frontend Developer (though I still have some decent HTML and CSS skills ;)).</p>

    <p>I always try to use the right tool for the problems I have to solve instead of using the same toolset over and
    over again for each and every project no matter what the requirements are. These circumstances allowed me to grow a
    broad knowledge about many different technologies in the web sphere and usually I don't need much time to familiarize
    with unknown technologies or projects.</p>

    <p>I must admit, though, that I have recently developed a lot of affection towards React (+ Ecosystem), Webpack and Node.js
    and so I try to primarily acquire projects where the usage of React would be useful.</p>

    <p>the logos reflect some of the technologies I've worked with in the past.</p>
